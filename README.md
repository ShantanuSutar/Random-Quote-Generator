# Random Quote Generator

The Random Quote Generator utilizes JavaScript to fetch quotes from an external API (Application Programming Interface). 

This API provides a vast collection of quotes from various sources, ensuring a wide range of inspirational, thought-provoking, or humorous content.

With each click of the "New Quote" button, a new quote is fetched from the API, offering fresh and dynamic content to the users.

To enhance the visual experience, I have incorporated a feature that dynamically changes the background color with each new quote. This adds a touch of variety and liveliness to the application, making each quote visually distinct and captivating.
